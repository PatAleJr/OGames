                        <p> I designed and built a 6x6 foot arena to safely contain combat robots up to 3 lbs. I raised $5900 from my university and sponsors for this project.
                            It has a steel frame, plywood boards for the floor, and 2 layers of polycarbonate walls. The arena is easily taken apart into beams and panels for transport and storage.
                            <br><br> I used Solidworks to design it, and applied stress simulations to ensure it could safely hold more than the intended load.

                        <p> I am currently the President of the Battlebots Club at my University (UBCO), where we design and construct combat robots for competitions.
                            I organized 2 internal competitions between students at my school, and manage the club's budget and inventory.

                        <p> A desktop program to simulate electric and magnetic fields in response to creating, destroying and moving charges.
                            It's like a sandbox type game where users are given lots of freedom to experiment.
                            <br> <br> Red spheres represent + charges, and blues are -. The arrowed lines are field lines: they point in the direction of where a + charge would go.
                            <br> <br> It is made in Unity and written in C#. A link will be available in the near future.</p>

                        <p> For the World Engineering Day Hackathon competition, I lead a team that designed a Mobile Rain Harvesting System to provide Canadian indigenous communities with clean
                            drinking
                            water. We finished second of over 120 teams from across the world.

                        <p> This is a downscaled prototype of an automated roof-top sprinkler system
                            that protects your property from wildfires. A sensor monitors ambient temperature and humidity and automatically waters your land
                            when fire risk is high.
                            <br><br> Of course, this will be ineffective in the middle of a forest fire. However, airborne embers from nearby wildfires can travel for kilometers
                            and land on dry debris, causing a new fire. Keeping your area moist will protect you from this.

                            so that all the 512 lights only use 7 pins.
