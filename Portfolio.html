                        <p> I am the Vice President of the UBCO Battlebots club, where we design and construct combat robots for competitions.
                            <br><br> Both prototypes on the left are made by me. The bodies were designed in Solidworks and 3D printed. The electronics are from Fingertech Robotics. 
                            <br><br> I am also organizing an internal tournament where members enter their 3D printed robot to fight in a ring.

                        <p> A desktop program to simulate electric and magnetic fields in response to creating, destroying and moving charges.
                            It's like a sandbox type game where users are given lots of freedom to experiment.
                            <br> <br> Red spheres represent + charges, and blues are -. The arrowed lines are field lines: they point in the direction of where a + charge would go.
                            <br> <br> It is made in Unity and written in C#. A link will be available in the near future.</p>

                        <p> For the World Engineering Day Hackathon, I lead a team that designed a Mobile Rain Harvesting System to provide Canadian indigenous communities with clean
                            drinking
                            water. We finished second of over 120 teams from across the world.
                        
                        <br><br> This portable rain barrel collects water with its polyester reinforced with polyurethane surface, and filters it through ceramic candle filters.

                        <p> This is a downscaled prototype of an automated roof-top sprinkler system
                            that protects your property from wildfires. A sensor monitors ambient temperature and humidity and automatically waters your land
                            when fire risk is high.
                            <br><br> Of course, this will be ineffective in the middle of a forest fire. However, airborne embers from nearby wildfires can travel for kilometers
                            and land on dry debris, causing a new fire. Keeping your area moist will protect you from this.

                            <br><br> I spent dozens of hours soldering each LED to this wire grid. I used shift registers and multiplexing principles
                            so that all the 512 lights only use 7 pins.
